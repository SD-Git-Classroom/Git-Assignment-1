Configure username, email, and editor in git
Fork repo https://github.com/cengique/bash_basics on Github
Clone your repo to your local computer in Git Bash
Make changes: Create a folder with your name, add a Bash script that prints your name
Add your file to git
Commit changes
Push changes
Create pull request
Step by step instructions
Step 1 & 2: Download Git and start a shell
All Git downloads can be found on https://git-scm.com/downloads

On Mac, open a terminal and type git to check if you have it already installed. Otherwise, you have two options, (1) install XCode from the App Store, but note that it is a large download; or (2) download the package from the link above. The rest of the assignment can be performed in the terminal console.
On Windows, download the package from the above link. During installation it will ask you to choose a text editor. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP! Pause the installation and install one of the editors on the list (Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc). Otherwise, you will have to set this up manually in the steps below, which is much harder. After installation completes, start the “Git Shell” from Programs. Note that inside the bash shell the folder separators will be forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\).
Step 3: Configure username, email, and editor in git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "<Your Email>" (Make sure email matches Github account, or simply add one more email to Github)
git config --list (Shows current configuration so you can verify)
If you have NOT selected an editor during installation (see above), then you must do:
git config --global core.editor "Full path to text editor" (Editor is used by git for adding commit/merge messages.
On Windows: use forward slashes (/) and quote the whole thing like '"this"' (Note the two sets of quotes: single quote outside and double quotes inside). Example: git config --global core.editor '"/c/Program Files/Notepad++/Notepad++.exe"'. The regular Notepad doesn't work for this purpose, so use a better editor like NotePad++, Atom (instructions), or gitpad.
On a Mac: Install Atom or Sublime Text and use full path to program. Example: git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Atom/MacOS/.../atom --wait" (you can use the tab key to complete the path)
And make sure it works by testing it with: git config --global -e
Step 4: Fork my Github repo
Click on https://github.com/cengique/bash_basics
Click “Fork” on top-right corner
This will make a copy of the project in your Github account
Step 5: Clone your Github repo into your local computer
Browse to your newly forked project on Github
Click on “Clone & Download”
Copy the URL for your repo
Open the terminal, and navigate to a proper folder to put your code using the cd command (See the bash_basics.sh file in the repo for help)
Run: git clone (paste the URL here) (This will create a folder with the repo's name in the current folder and download all files.)
Step 6: Make changes
Open the basics.sh file with a text editor and read its contents to learn about general Bash commands to achieve desired result. You can try these commands in the Git Bash shell or Mac terminal.
Either using command line or your file browser, make a copy of 01-read_input.sh with a new name
Edit the new file with a text editor (not with Notepad, but with Notepad++, Atom, etc.) and follow its formatting to make a new script (You only the need the first line that indicates that it's a Bash script, and the first echo line that prints out the welcome message)
Modify the echo line to include your name
Make it executable by running chmod +x (your file here). Then, test it by running it on your command line like ./(your file here) or sh (your file here).
Step 7: Add your file to git
Git will usually tell you what's the most logical next step when you run: git status
To add your file, run: git add (your filename)
Run git status again to see what's the next step
Step 8 & 9: Commit and push your changes
Run: git commit -m "your change message" (Make sure to always put a meaningful message, but you don't have the explain the details since they will be obvious in the code itself)
Optionally, set up a SSH key-pair to log into Github without a password. Otherwise you'll have to type your password every time you pull/push. Follow this article.
To publish your changes back online to Github, run: git push --set-upstream origin master. Once you do this once, next time you can simply run: git push
Then you can go to your Github page and click “commits” to see your changes
Step 10: Create a pull request to me on Github
You made changes in your own repo, but my original repo is not affected. If you want me to publish your changes, you need to send me a “pull request” – meaning that I should pull your changes and merge into my own repo.
To do this, go to your Github repo and click on “New pull request”. Then select my repo (not Dr Tacksoon Im's repo!) and then make sure to click on "Create pull request". You will need to name it and submit.
Make sure your request shows up on the outstanding requests here
I will grade you on completing all these steps.
